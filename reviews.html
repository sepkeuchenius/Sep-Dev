The input of the survey goes into the sheet and an output is sent to the personâ€™s email. He totally had this idea and Conley on his own. I had Originally wanted an editable pdf, but that was not going to work due to my complex formulas in the doc. Jozef came up with the idea and executed it brilliantly. I will definitely ask him for more jobs in the future. He is a genius!"',
